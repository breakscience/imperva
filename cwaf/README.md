Steps to use this script:

1.	Set up Terraform:
        Make sure you have Terraform installed on your system. If not, you can download it from Terraform’s website.
2.	Imperva Provider:
        Ensure the Imperva Terraform provider is available. You might need to check the provider documentation for the most current version and configuration options.
3.	API Credentials:
        Obtain your API ID and API Key from Imperva. These are necessary for authentication and authorization to manage your Imperva account via Terraform.
4.	Variables:
        Define the variables either in a terraform.tfvars file or directly when running Terraform commands. An example terraform.tfvars file could look like this:

            imperva_api_id = "your_api_id_here"
            imperva_api_key = "your_api_key_here"
            site_name = "example.com"
            site_ip = "192.0.2.1"
            custom_certificate = <<EOF
            -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
            ...certificate content...
            -----END CERTIFICATE-----
            EOF
            custom_certificate_key = <<EOF
            -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
            ...private key content...
            -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
            EOF
            cname = "cname.example.com"

5.	Run Terraform Commands:
	•	Initialize the Terraform workspace: terraform init
	•	Plan the Terraform execution: terraform plan
	•	Apply the Terraform plan: terraform apply

This script creates a new site on Imperva Cloud WAF with the specified configurations. Make sure to adjust the variables and resource parameters according to your specific requirements and the latest Imperva provider documentation.
